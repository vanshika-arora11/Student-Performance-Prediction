# Student-Performance-Prediction
Description
This project predicts student performance (pass/fail) based on features like absences, study time, tutoring, and parental support using a Random Forest classifier. The model is trained on a dataset and evaluated with accuracy, precision, and recall metrics. A confusion matrix heatmap is also visualized to assess performance.

Requirements-
pandas
seaborn
matplotlib
sklearn

Dataset-
The dataset used in this project is called "8. Student Performance Prediction.csv", and it contains student-related data such as:
Absences: Number of absences of the student.
StudyTimeWeekly: Amount of time spent on studying each week.
Tutoring: Whether the student receives tutoring (binary value).
ParentalSupport: Whether the student has parental support (binary value).
GPA: The student's Grade Point Average.

Steps-
Data Upload: Upload the dataset.
Feature Selection: Use features like absences, study time, tutoring, and parental support.
Model Training: Train a Random Forest classifier.
Evaluation: Visualize the confusion matrix and calculate accuracy, precision, and recall.
